# Bookshelf App

This repository contains a template of a React application and a SQLite database managed by Prisma. Both applications are served in two different ports. Then, the student can simulate server/client interactions with a REST or GraphQL API (Prisma makes both possible). The idea is to have a starting point for practicing data presentation, handling user input, submitting data to a server etc.

## Getting started

- npm i
- npm start

## Managing the database

- npx prisma studio
